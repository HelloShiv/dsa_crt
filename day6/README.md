# Linked List
Linked List is also a linear data structure in which new elements can be inserted or items can be deleted from any position (start , end or middle)

## Type of Linked List:-
- One way Linked List(Singly)
- Two way Linked List(Doubly)
- Circular Linked List
  - Circular one way LL
  - Circular two way LL
- Header Linked List
  - Header one way LL
  - Header two way LL
  - Header circular LL


### Difference between Array and Linked List

| Array | Linked List |
|-------|-------------|
|Array elements are stored in continuous memory locations | elements of LL are stored in non continous memory location|
|Array size cant be incresed or decreased during runtime so there is shortage or wastage of memory| We can increase or decrease the size during runtime so no shortage and no wastage of memroy |
| Elements of arrays can be acccessed `Randomly or directly O(1)` | Elements can only be accessed `SEQUENTIALLY O(n)` |
| One element of array sotre less memory than one node of LinkedList | But LinkedList in long run Linked List save more memory than array|
| We can use binary Search on array | But not on LL |
